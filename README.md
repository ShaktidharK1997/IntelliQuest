# SWProject

### Description:
Our project aims to develop a specialized search engine dedicated to academic papers, serving as a comprehensive resource for students, professors, researchers, and industry experts. Designed with ease of access in mind, it provides a single platform where users can find and explore scholarly articles and publications across various fields. Beyond simple search functionality, our search engine will offer personalized recommendations based on individual search histories. By analyzing user interactions, it will suggest relevant papers and topics, tailoring content to align with users' interests and research needs. This feature is intended to not only enhance the user experience but also to inspire discovery and learning by connecting users with content that resonates with their current interests and professional pursuits.

### Major Features:

Here are some major features of our project.
* Advanced Search Options: This will allow users to search by keywords, authors, publication dates, journals, and citation metrics.
* Filtering and Sorting: This should enable users to filter search results by relevance, publication date, citation count, and journal impact factor.
* Relevance Ranking: Our search engine should prioritize the most relevant and impactful research papers on top.
* Citation Analysis: The search engine should provide information on the number of citations a paper has received and its overall impact in the field.
* User Profiles: This should allow users to create profiles, save favorite papers, create reading lists, follow authors, and organize papers into folders or tags.
* Notification and Alerts: We can provide customizable alerts for new papers matching users' interests and updates on citations on their published papers.
* Mobile-Friendly Interface: We have to make sure the search engine is responsive and optimized for mobile devices. This will also allow easy access of papers to the users.
